        <h2> >> Overview</h2>

        <p>
            The art of growing a bonsai is really admirable. 
            As much as I would love to grow one of my own, I fear for what I would do to the poor tree. 
            This is my compromise: a wire bonsai tree. 
            I made it with aluminum wire, meticulously bent and coiled into shape. 
            It rests atop a souvenir stone I found at a beach in Northern Quebec. 
            I potted it in a small white ceramic pot and surrounded the roots with fake moss. 
            Now, it sits on my windowsill, catching the afternoon sun.<br>

            Though the piece itself is simple, I feel an odd connection to it, much like how a bonsai practitioner would be connected to their trees. 
            I suppose that making a tree like this isn't too distant from the real deal, the only difference is that I omitted the years of dedication.
