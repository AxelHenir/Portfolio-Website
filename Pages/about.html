        <h2> >> Artist Statement</h2>

        <p>
            My work engages with the autonomy of and our interactions with computerized artifacts. 
            I design and make physical objects equipped with sensorial, behavioral and computational qualities. 
            In my work, I like to use found objects, often in combination with custom made parts and electronics. 
            The self taught engineer and musician Martin Molin inspires me to take common, everyday items or ideas and enchant them with new possibilities. 
            I show no fear in trying something new and outlandish, crossing concepts and remodeling the nature of the subject.
            The artifact’s newfound form, affordances and purpose are the crux of my practice and how I engage in artistic discourse. 
            My work challenges our notions of the affordances of casual objects by repurposing, modifying and hacking them to act in novel ways.
