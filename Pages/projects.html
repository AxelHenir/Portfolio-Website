        <h4>"1 Million" (2023) - Generative art making website</h4>
        <p>Made with the commonly-used creative coding library, p5.js. This website is an homage to generative art and allows you to explore
            generative models on a 1000 x 1000 (1 million) pixel canvas. For each technique, you can play with the parameters, regenerate and save your creations.

        <h4>"A Reminder for the Future" (2024) - Puzzle video game</h4>
        <p>Made as an entry to a Concordia game jam and produced in a team of 3, "A Reminder for the future" is a puzzle game about emotional healing. For this event, participants were given the theme of "memory" to adhere to.
            We decided to make a game about trauma, specifically leaning into how we navigate uncomfortable memories as a form of emotional growth. I primarily carried
            out the production of the game's environments, crafting the memories' layouts not just as the set but as a piece in the game's overarching puzzle.

        <h4>"Voronoi" Visualizer" (2022) - Generative audio visualizer demo</h4>
        <p>A p5.js sketch which uses music to generate visuals. This project was inspired by Raven Kwok and his work, which I would call a combination
            of computer science, motion graphics and wizardry. I used beat detection and amplitude analysis to make the visuals follow the music's energy and rhythm.
            I also allow the user to change the motion patterns live, creating dazzling, dancing voronois to whatever song you like!

        <h4>"Fireworks" (2023) - Audiovisual Poem </h4>
        <p>A video poem about how human experience is the underlying root of understanding our world, made in response to the mounting presence of AI in creative industries.
            The word "fireworks" would be seen as a data point in a computer but for us humans, hearing a simple word can stir up so much more in us. Made in combination with stable diffusion.
