        <h2> >> Overview</h2>

        <p>
            The DigiLute began with a loosely defined goal- to make a musical instrument that incorporates the performer's body in its playing. 
            I wanted to create something that was equally visual and audible. I knew I was looking to make something fun, as the project's main inspirations
            are rooted in fantasy and video games. I spent time creating prototypes using large, taped-together cardboard pieces.
            This procedure helped me identify the meaningful interactiosn I wanted to include in future, refined iterations. 
            When I felt content with a form, I would make note of the potential sensors I could use. 
            After several iterations, I landed on what I called "the pizza wheel", which resembles the DigiLute's form today. <br> <br>

        <h2> >> Production</h2>
            
        <p>
            The DigiLute took 2 full weeks to print on my 3D printer, at roughly 95% printing uptime in those 2 weeks.
            The finished product came out to over 50 individual pieces, about 1.5 kg of PETG plastic.
            I did something different this time around, having learned from my previous, 3d printer-involved project, breakbot;
            I kept all the failed prints and unused pieces of plastic. This was a hard thing to do, personally. 
            In the end, I produced a sizeable amount of waste- not something to be proud of but to be aware of nonetheless. 
            The discarded plastic scraps represent countless hours of research, trial and error, which fundamentally built up and reinforced the basis of knowledge I used in this endeavour.

        <h2> >> Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            The DigiLute will be demonstrated on April 10th, 2024 on my YouTube channel and here, on this website.
